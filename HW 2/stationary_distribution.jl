# This file contains the code for solving for the stationary wealth distribution.
# Given the policy function from the value function iteration, we use the T star
# operator to find the stationary distribution μ.


# Initialize_SD: function that initializes the results struct for solving stationary distribution
function Initialize_SD()

# Make_trans_matrix: function that creates the transition matrix that maps from
# the current state (s, a) to future state (s', a').
